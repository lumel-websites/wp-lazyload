This plugin lazy loads videos and iframes on your page by using a placeholder preview image in place of the content. The video or iframe loads only when the preview image is clicked. All the scripts and styles for the content are loaded only when the placeholder image is clicked, thus improving your site performance as well as increasing your Google PageSpeed/GTMetrix Score.
